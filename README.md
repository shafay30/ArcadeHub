# ArcadeHub
 ArcadeHub is a Java Swing project featuring a collection of early 2000s arcade-style games, each encapsulated in its own file. The main UI presents a grid of game thumbnails; clicking on a thumbnail launches the selected game. Current games include classics like Snake, Pong, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Pac-Man.
